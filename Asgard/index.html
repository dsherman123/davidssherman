                  DK&amp;A only played a few professional gigs, often having to renegotiate their fees after their performance.&nbsp;
                  It may have been for this reason that the vast majority of their performances were free.&nbsp;
                  They were open to anyone who hadn't already left and wanted to join in the music.&nbsp;
                  Although never receiving the critical accolades enjoyed by other bands of the day, Dave King was immensely popular with his fans;
                  which critics attributed to the fact that "<em><strong>most of his fans join him onstage, grab instruments, and start playing.&nbsp;
                  The rest are too drugged to notice how horrible the music is</strong>!</em>" (Steve Carson, Creem Magazine, 1975)

                      Grand Funk Railroad, and Norse Mythology (all of whom have a class action suit still pending against Dave King for defamation and public humiliation,
                      including Odin, King of the Aesir).&nbsp; Dave's first performance was captured on a wire recording from 1960, shortly after he completed his speech therapy;
                      his final exam being the correct pronunciation of his speech teacher's name - Mrs. Ellenbogen.&nbsp; Like many musicians, Dave began by studying classical music;
                      playing first trumpet for the Parkman Junior High Orchestra.&nbsp; His trumpet solo on Autumn Leaves at the 1967 Spring PTA Jubilee reportedly had his mother in tears
                      (although opinions as to why differ- pride or embarrassment).&nbsp; Dave gave up trumpet, and turned to the guitar, being entirely self-taught, which was blatantly obvious
                      according to most critics.&nbsp; His refusal to take music lessons or instruction were credited (blamed?) for his unique style and sound, something Dave, inexplicably,
                      accepted as a compliment.

                Dave King played Yamaki 6 and 12-string acoustic guitars in addition to his $11 1969 6-string electric St. George that he retrofitted with a $60 Gibson Humbucker pickup.&nbsp;
                His favorite guitar was his Yamaha 6-string electric, picked up while on tour in Japan. It was fitted with one of the first wireless transmitters ever seen in the US and,
                in fact, many music historians credit Dave King with bringing about wireless live performance.&nbsp; Rob Gershon, Rolling Stone music critic, was rumored to have said,
                <em><strong>&nbsp;"The only way I'd ever go to a Dave King and Asgard concert is if they played without wires or electric guitar cables!"</strong></em>
              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                Dave King's recording technique was unique; inspired by both the 1971 NASA Project Cyclops (the 1,500 array of radio telescopes to search for extra-terrestrial intelligence)
                as well as animal experiments in which a chimpanzee or elephant were given a paint brush and canvas and then left to create art.&nbsp; Dave King would simply bring out some instruments,
                call some friends, start recording, and see what happened.&nbsp; The idea was that he too, would create art.&nbsp; Opinions still differ greatly as to whether or not that is what happened.&nbsp;
                Dave had a style that, rather than lead guitar,&nbsp; critics began to refer to as "<strong><em>&nbsp;lost guitar</em></strong>."&nbsp; "Dave King's lead, or should I say<em><strong>&nbsp;lost,</strong></em>&nbsp;
                style is avant garde in quite a disturbing way.&nbsp; If only he could play a scale, or even know what one was, his music might be bearable rather than embarrassing," John Greshing, Guitar Gods Magazine, vol. 4, 1974.
              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                Only a handful of artists are credited with creating works that withstand the ages, transcend time and space, evoking emotions and touching the very center of the human soul and spirit.
                Some of the names that come to everyone's mind are da Vinci, Michelangelo, Beethoven, Renoir, Mozart, Van Gogh, ... sadly, Dave King did not join their ranks.&nbsp; In fact, after a comprehensive listening to all the known recordings
                of Dave King &amp; Asgard, music critics agree that Dave King singlehandedly ruined hundreds of potentially beautiful recordings.
              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                Thankfully, Dave stopped touring after a crash landing from one of his signature jumps tore both his ACLs.&nbsp; World-renowned orthopedic surgeon Carlan Yates (a previous band member) told Dave he'd never play guitar again
                (actually he begged him not to).
              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                Like many musicians, Dave King went off in search of new sounds.&nbsp; One of his treks landed him in Africa where he found new energy and a creative spark (thankfully not musical).&nbsp;
                He recently published an African wildlife coffee table book from his safari-&nbsp;
                <strong><a href="https://www.davidssherman.com/Asgard/africa.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFRICA&nbsp;</a>.&nbsp;</strong>
